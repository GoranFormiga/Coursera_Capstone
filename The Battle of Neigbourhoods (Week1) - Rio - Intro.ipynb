    ">Rio de Janeiro is the second most populous municipality in Brazil with 6.72 million inhabitants according to the 2019 statistics. There are 16 boroughs and 163 neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro. It is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro and has headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining and telecomunication companies. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visitered cities in the South America and it is known for the \"Christ the Redeemer\" statue, the \"Sugarloaf\" Mountain, Carnaval, Samba, Bossa Nova and the beaches, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro. An other interesting thing is the number of bars and restaurants with tastes from all over the world. We are going to focus our study on the Brazilian Restaurants in the following two  boroughs:\n",
    ">* The South Zone (Zona Sul), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro#South_Zone\n",
    ">* Central Zone (Centro), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro#Central_Zone\n",
    ">\n",
    ">These two boroughs have together 32 neighbourhoods that are common locations for the stakeholders involved in this study."
